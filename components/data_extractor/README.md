# Component Name: DataExtractor

## Description

The DataExtractor component is designed to process input data (in the form of a workbook) and extract relevant information based on the provided configuration. This component can process data using either Excel APIs or pandas, which can be specified in the component configuration.

## Input and Output Models

### Input Model: `DataExtractorInputDict`

The input model is a Pydantic BaseModel that validates and serializes the input data.

- `input_workbook: dict`: The input workbook data as a dictionary.

### Output Model: `DataExtractorOutputDict`

The output model is a Pydantic BaseModel that validates and serializes the output data.

- `processed_data: dict`: The extracted and processed data in the form of a dictionary.

## Parameters

- `data_processing_method: str`: Specifies the method to process the input data. It can be either 'excel_apis' (for Excel APIs) or 'pandas' (for pandas). This parameter is loaded from the component configuration file.
- `data_extraction_config_path: str`: The path to the data extraction configuration file, which contains specifics on how to extract relevant information from the input data. This parameter is loaded from the component configuration file.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` function takes a `DataExtractorInputDict` object as input and returns a `DataExtractorOutputDict` object. The function performs the following steps:

1. Load the data extraction configuration from the specified file.

2. Convert the input workbook data into a pandas DataFrame.

3. Depending on the `data_processing_method`, process the input data using either Excel APIs or pandas (currently implemented as placeholders).

4. Identify and extract relevant data patterns, trends, and anomalies from the input data, updating the `processed_data` dictionary with the results.

5. Return a `DataExtractorOutputDict` object with the extracted and processed data.

## External Dependencies

- `os`: Used for working with system paths.
- `yaml`: Used for parsing and loading YAML configuration files.
- `pandas`: Used for handling and processing the input data.
- `dotenv`: Used for loading environment variables from a .env file.
- `fastapi`: Used to create a FastAPI instance for this component.
- `pydantic`: Used for data validation and serialization using BaseModel.

## API Calls

This component does not make direct API calls. However, it is designed to process data from external sources and interact with other components using the FastAPI instance (`data_extractor_app`).

## Error Handling

Currently, error handling is minimal, and specific exceptions and error messages are not implemented. Improvements in error handling are recommended to provide better context and support when the component encounters issues.

## Examples

To use the DataExtractor in a Yeager Workflow, you need to provide a proper data extraction configuration file and adjust the input data accordingly. You also need to configure the `data_processing_method` parameter in the component configuration file according to the required data processing technique ('excel_apis' or 'pandas'). Then you can pass the input data in the form of a `DataExtractorInputDict` object to the `transform()` function, which will return the extracted and processed data as a `DataExtractorOutputDict` object.
