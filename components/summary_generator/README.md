# SummaryGenerator Component

## 1. Component Name

SummaryGenerator

## 2. Description

The SummaryGenerator component is designed to generate a textual summary based on the output data from the DataExtractor component. It utilizes NLP models like GPT-3 or BERT to generate the summary, and can also include visual aids such as graphs to support the generated content.

## 3. Input and Output Models

### Input Model:
**SummaryGeneratorInputDict:**
- `DataExtractor_output`: A list representing the output data extracted by the DataExtractor component.

### Output Model:
**SummaryGeneratorOutputDict:**
- `summary`: A string representing the generated summary, which may also include visual aids or graphs to support the content.

Both input and output models inherit from Pydantic's BaseModel for validation and serialization purposes.

## 4. Parameters

### `model_type` (str)
- Specifies the NLP model to be used for generating the summary. Options are `'GPT-3'` or `'BERT'`.
- Defined in the component's configuration file (YAML file).

### `summary_length` (int)
- Specifies the maximum length of the generated summary.
- Defined in the component's configuration file (YAML file).

## 5. Transform Function

The `transform()` function is the main function of the SummaryGenerator component. It operates as follows:

1. Load and initialize the chosen NLP model (either GPT-3 or BERT) as per the `model_type` parameter.
2. Preprocess the input data (extracted data from the DataExtractor component).
3. Feed the preprocessed data into the NLP model.
4. Generate the summary based on the NLP model's output, limiting it to the specified `summary_length`.
5. Include any relevant visual aids or graphs to support the summary.
6. Return the generated summary as the final output.

## 6. External Dependencies

- `yaml` for parsing the component's configuration file.
- `dotenv` for managing environment variables.
- `fastapi` for creating the FastAPI app and API endpoint.
- `pydantic` for defining input and output data models.

## 7. API Calls

External API calls may be made to the chosen NLP model's API (GPT-3 or BERT) to generate the summary. The specific details of these calls depend on the choice of the NLP model and its API.

## 8. Error Handling

Errors are handled by the built-in error handling mechanisms provided by FastAPI, Pydantic, and any libraries used for the chosen NLP model.

## 9. Examples

Examples showcasing the use of the SummaryGenerator component within a Yeager Workflow would cover:

1. Configuring the component's settings (selecting the NLP model and specifying the summary length).
2. Providing input data from the DataExtractor component.
3. Receiving the generated summary as output.
