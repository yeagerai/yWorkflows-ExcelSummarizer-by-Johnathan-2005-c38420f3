# ExcelSummarizer

The ExcelSummarizer component is designed to read data from an uploaded Excel workbook, analyze its contents (i.e., summaries and formula usage) and generate a Word document output containing the analysis results. The component will use the ExcelWorkbookInput, which inherits from the BaseModel, as its input data model, and the WordDocumentOutput, also inheriting from the BaseModel, as its output data model.
