# Component Name
ExcelWorkbookReader

# Description
The ExcelWorkbookReader component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow designed to read Excel workbooks and return their contents as structured data. This component supports reading Excel files using the 'openpyxl' and 'pandas' libraries and can be configured to use either library based on the preferences specified in the component's YAML configuration file.

# Input and Output Models
- Input Model: `ExcelWorkbookReaderInputDict`
    - `excel_file_path` (str): The file path of the Excel file to read
    
- Output Model: `ExcelWorkbookReaderOutputDict`
    - `workbook_data` (Any): The structured data parsed from the Excel workbook

Both input and output models use Pydantic for validation and serialization.

# Parameters
- `library_choice` (str): The library to use for reading the Excel workbook. The valid options are "openpyxl" and "pandas". The parameter is set in the component's YAML configuration file.

# Transform Function
The `transform` function of the ExcelWorkbookReader component performs the following steps:

1. Check the `library_choice` specified in the configuration file.
2. If the choice is "openpyxl", use `load_workbook` function from the openpyxl library to read the Excel workbook.
3. If the choice is "pandas", use `read_excel` function from the pandas library with the parameter `sheet_name=None` to read the Excel workbook.
4. If an invalid library choice is specified, raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.
5. Return the structured data from the Excel workbook as an instance of `ExcelWorkbookReaderOutputDict`.

# External Dependencies
- `openpyxl`: A library used to read and manipulate the Excel workbooks using the load_workbook function.
- `pandas`: A library used to read and manipulate the Excel workbooks using the read_excel function.
- `pydantic`: A library used to create input and output data models and validate the data accordingly.

# API Calls
There are no external API calls made by the ExcelWorkbookReader component.

# Error Handling
- If an invalid library choice is specified in the YAML configuration, the `transform` function will raise a ValueError with the message "Invalid library_choice specified in the configuration."

# Examples
For example, to use the ExcelWorkbookReader component in a Yeager Workflow, first set up the YAML configuration file as follows:
